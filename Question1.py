Check if a Number is Divisible by Exactly One of the Given Numbers
Write a function div_by_exactly_one that takes three integers num, a, and b. The function should return True if num is divisible by exactly one of the numbers a or b, and False otherwise.

NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Examples:

    • num=20, a=5, b=6 --> True (20 is divisible by 5 only)

    • num=20, a=5, b=10 --> False (20 is divisible by both 5 and 10)

    • num=20, a=6, b=10 --> True (20 is divisible by 10 only)

    • num=20, a=6, b=7 --> False (20 is not divisible by either 6 or 7)
